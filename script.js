// add event listeners to each of the buttons and console log which was pressed each time one is clicked



// select the card-container div using a query selector.




// add at least 2 more people to your users array below
let currentuser = 0

let users = [

    name: 'Ben Siegel',

  },
]

// This is a LOT, so you'll need to break it down. Here are some good options for where to start.
// Option 1: create a function that changes the user's name, image and description on the webpage. It should take the INDEX of the array as an arguement.
// Option 2: clear out the card-container div using the innerHTML property. Then fill it up with a the skeleton code from inside the card-container div, but with names and imageURL changed.
// Option 3: make the next and back buttons work, but for now only worry about console logging the new data.

// Once you have those bits working, start thinking about how to modify them.
